# Codebase Review Question Audit

## Purpose

Use this skill to perform a deep, structured review of a project before implementation or refactoring begins.

The purpose is to understand the codebase holistically and generate a `QUESTIONS.md` file containing all relevant technical, architectural, behavioral, product, security, and maintainability questions that should be answered before making broad changes.

This skill is designed for discovery, not implementation.

---

## Position in the workflow

This is **Phase 1 — Discovery** of the review-to-release workflow.

### Inputs

This skill expects access to the codebase and any supporting project documentation.

### Produces

- `QUESTIONS.md`

### Recommended next skill

- `questions-md-resolution-implementation`

### Do not proceed automatically if

- `QUESTIONS.md` still needs human answers
- major ambiguities remain unresolved
- the user wants to review the questions first

---

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- review the whole codebase
- identify odd patterns, unclear decisions, or risks
- prepare questions before refactoring
- understand the architecture before making changes
- perform a discovery pass as a tech lead or staff engineer

Do not use this skill when the user explicitly wants direct implementation without a discovery phase.

---

## Core mindset

Act as:

- a professional code reviewer
- a staff/principal engineer
- a tech lead performing technical discovery

Your job is to understand first, question second, and change later.

If something looks unclear, risky, inconsistent, incomplete, or surprising, turn it into a question.

Do not assume intent when the code is ambiguous.

---

## Review scope

Review the project as broadly and deeply as possible, including where applicable:

- folder and module structure
- architecture and boundaries
- framework conventions
- dependency choices
- environment variable usage
- build and deployment assumptions
- pages, routes, screens, and layouts
- API endpoints and handlers
- domain modeling and business logic
- persistence and data access
- authentication and authorization
- validation and error handling
- async flows and retries
- performance hotspots and caching
- observability and logging
- tests and coverage strategy
- duplication, dead code, and naming consistency
- security flaws
- missing docs and implicit decisions

---

## Execution process

### 1. Understand the system first

Infer internally:

- what the project appears to do
- who the likely users are
- what the critical flows are
- what the stack and architectural center are
- what seems mature versus unfinished

### 2. Review the codebase systematically

Inspect the repository area by area and identify:

- ambiguity
- weak boundaries
- fragile logic
- missing invariants
- hidden assumptions
- missing validation
- missing tests
- security concerns
- product behavior ambiguity
- performance risks
- under-documented decisions

### 3. Convert findings into questions

Every relevant concern must be phrased as a question, not as a refactor prescription.

Good:

- “Should this endpoint be authenticated, or is open access intentional?”

Avoid:

- “Refactor this into a service.”

### 4. Group questions by area

Organize questions into sections such as:

- Product & Intended Behavior
- Architecture
- Code Structure & Boundaries
- API Design
- Data & Persistence
- Security
- Performance
- Error Handling & Resilience
- Testing & QA
- Observability
- Documentation
- Technical Debt / Suspicious Areas
- Possible Bugs
- Missing Decisions / Open Design Gaps

### 5. Make each question independently answerable

Each question should be:

- specific
- contextualized
- self-contained
- easy to answer directly

Include when useful:

- file path
- symbol or module name
- why the question matters
- risk if unanswered

### 6. Be exhaustive

Do not optimize for brevity. Optimize for completeness and clarity.

---

## Output

Create:

`QUESTIONS.md`

Suggested structure:

# QUESTIONS.md

## Project Understanding Summary

Brief summary of what the system appears to do, how it seems structured, and what high-risk areas were identified.

## How to Answer

Explain that the project owner should answer each question directly and mark whether the item is:

- intended behavior
- bug
- approved improvement
- deferred
- out-of-scope

## Questions

### 1. Product & Intended Behavior

#### Q1. ...

- **Where:** `...`
- **Why this matters:** ...
- **Question:** ...

### 2. Architecture

#### Q2. ...

- **Where:** `...`
- **Why this matters:** ...
- **Question:** ...

Continue until all relevant questions are captured.

## Suggested answer tags

Use these tags consistently in answers:

- `verified`
- `partial`
- `blocked`
- `deferred`
- `out-of-scope`
- `caveat`

---

## Quality bar

A strong `QUESTIONS.md`:

- reveals ambiguity before implementation
- creates a real decision backlog
- exposes risky assumptions
- improves the quality of future refactors
- reduces the chance of changing the wrong thing

A weak `QUESTIONS.md` is shallow, generic, and misses behavior/security/performance/design risks.

---

## Constraints

Do not:

- change code automatically
- assume intended behavior silently
- jump into implementation
- collapse multiple concerns into vague notes

Do:

- inspect broadly
- question precisely
- anchor questions in evidence
- prefer clarity over politeness

---

## Handoff to next phase

This skill ends when `QUESTIONS.md` is complete.

### Recommended next step

Run `questions-md-resolution-implementation` **only after** the project owner has answered `QUESTIONS.md`.

### Stop condition

If `QUESTIONS.md` is unanswered or incomplete, do not continue to implementation.
